// This file is the bridge between goroutines and the loop goroutine,
// the toolkit half of the threading contract in docs/threading.md:
//
//   - Invoke(fn) queues fn for the loop goroutine and kicks the parked
//     loop with one coalesced wake, so a background goroutine can move
//     data onto the screen without ever touching a widget itself.
//   - Every(d, fn) runs fn on the loop goroutine at a fixed cadence -
//     the shape of a poller - riding the loop's timer-wake computation
//     instead of spawning a ticker goroutine that would fight the park.
//
// Both are safe to call from any goroutine; the fn they run is loop
// code, subject to the same rules as event callbacks.

// loopQueues is the application's off-loop -> on-loop plumbing: the
// invoke queue, the periodic timers, and the flag marking the loop
// dead. One mutex covers it all; the structures are small and the
