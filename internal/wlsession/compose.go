// Compose wiring. The session owns the compose table (resolved once
// from $XCOMPOSEFILE, ~/.XCompose, then the system locale file) and
// the single seat-wide state machine: Wayland keyboard focus is
// seat-wide, so a sequence in flight belongs to the seat, not to a
// surface. With no compose file anywhere the state is nil, and every
// method here degrades to the disabled machine — dead-key layouts
// then behave exactly as before this wiring existed.

// loadCompose resolves and parses the active compose file, opening the
// seat's compose state. Errors (no file, bad file) leave compose
// disabled rather than failing the connection.

// FeedCompose advances the compose machine by the keysym of a key
// press, answering pending, done-with-text, or none. None means the
// keysym takes no part in compose and normal text handling should
// proceed; a sequence that was in flight has been cancelled by then.

// ComposeBackspace unwinds one level of an in-flight sequence,

// backspace either way when a sequence was in flight — the widget must
// not delete text for it — and passes it through when none was.
