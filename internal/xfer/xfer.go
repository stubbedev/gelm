// Package xfer moves selection and drag-and-drop payloads through the
// pipes Wayland hands the two ends of a transfer. Both ends are
// foreign clients — the offer we read from, the consumer we write to —
// and either may be hostile or broken: an app on the machine can offer
// a text payload and stream gigabytes into a paste, or request our
// selection and never read it. Every transfer here is therefore
// bounded twice: in size, so a peer cannot grow our memory without
// limit, and in time, so a stalled peer cannot hang a paste or the
