// Package media is gelm's playback framework, GTK's GtkMediaStream in
// pure Go: a Source decodes frames (and, when Audible, sound), and a
// Stream plays one on the loop with play, pause, seek, loop, volume and
// a clock that follows the audio when there is any. widget.Video paints
// a Stream and widget.MediaControls drives it.
//
// Built-in sources: animated images (NewAnimation), YUV4MPEG2 (NewY4M,
// decoded here), and any file ffmpeg reads (OpenFile, which runs
// ffmpeg and ffprobe from PATH as subprocesses). Sound plays through
// the PulseAudio native protocol, which PulseAudio and pipewire-pulse
// serve.
//
//	src, err := media.OpenFile("talk.webm")
