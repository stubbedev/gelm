// Subtree opacity: the embeddable state and the PushAlpha discipline

// through every widget color by hand; an Opacity-carrying widget pushes

// color its subtree produces — fills, borders, text, image blits — is
// modulated in one place, and nested carriers multiply.

// Opacity carries a widget's subtree opacity: a factor in [0, 1] the
// widget applies around its children's paint. Widgets that wrap children
// embed it beside node, call bindOpacity from their constructor, and
// route child painting through paintChild. The factor lands on the
// canvas's PushAlpha stack, so nested carriers compose multiplicatively
// and the modulation reaches every blended primitive by construction.
//
// The type has no Opacity getter on purpose: an accessor named like the
// embedded field would shadow the embedding itself (toast.Opacity()
// would collide with the promoted Opacity field). Alpha is the getter.

// tween's overshoot saturates instead of over-brightening. A change
// invalidates the host's bounds, so the next frame repaints the subtree

// it skips the subtree entirely, which is what makes tween endpoints
// free. It composes with the animation clock directly — a tween
